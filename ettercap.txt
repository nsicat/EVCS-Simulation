## Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not installed)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easier to install Linux-based tools.

## Installation

Open Terminal and run:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, make sure to add Homebrew to your PATH (if prompted) by running:

```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 2: Install Ettercap

Once Homebrew is installed, install Ettercap by running:

```
brew install ettercap
```

This will install Ettercap with its necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Check if Ettercap is installed correctly:

Bash

```
ettercap --version
```

or try launching the graphical version:

Bash

```
ettercap -G
```

## Step 4: Grant Permissions (If Needed)

Since Ettercap requires network sniffing privileges, you might need to grant extra permissions:

Run Ettercap with sudo:

Bash

```
sudo ettercap -G
```

If you get permission errors, you may need to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) temporarily (not recommended unless necessary).

## Step 5: Running Ettercap

## Graphical Mode (GUI)

Bash

```
sudo ettercap -G
```
