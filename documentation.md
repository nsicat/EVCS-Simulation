# TLS Implementation for EVCS-CSMS Communication

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption for the communication between the Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) and the Charging Station Management System (CSMS). This security enhancement ensures that all JSON messages exchanged between these components are encrypted during transmission.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Certificate Generation
We'll create self-signed certificates for development/testing purposes. In a production environment, these should be replaced with certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

Required files:
- `server.key`: Private key for the CSMS server
- `server.crt`: Public certificate for the CSMS server
- `ca.crt`: Certificate Authority certificate (for client verification)

### 2. Code Changes

#### CSMS Server Changes
- Replace plain TCP socket with SSL/TLS socket
- Configure server with certificate and private key
- Implement client certificate verification (optional)
- Maintain the same JSON message format but over encrypted channel

#### EVCS Client Changes
- Replace plain TCP socket with SSL/TLS socket
- Configure client to verify server certificate
- Implement client certificate if mutual authentication is required
- Maintain the same JSON message format but over encrypted channel

### 3. Security Features
- **Encryption**: All communication is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- **Authentication**: Server authentication through certificates
- **Integrity**: Message integrity is ensured through TLS
- **Forward Secrecy**: Provided by TLS 1.3 protocol

## Setup Instructions

1. Generate certificates (for development):
```bash
# Generate CA key and certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=EVCS-CA"

# Generate server key and CSR
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=CSMS-Server"

# Sign server certificate with CA
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
```

2. Place certificates in a `certs` directory:
```
certs/
  ├── ca.crt
  ├── server.key
  └── server.crt
```

3. Update configuration in code to use the certificates

## Testing
- Verify TLS handshake success
- Confirm encrypted communication using Wireshark
- Test certificate validation
- Verify handling of invalid certificates

## Security Considerations
1. Keep private keys secure and never commit them to version control
2. Use strong cipher suites
3. Regularly update certificates before expiration
4. In production, use certificates from trusted CAs
5. Implement proper certificate validation
6. Consider implementing Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking

## Error Handling
The implementation includes proper error handling for:
- Certificate validation failures
- TLS handshake failures
- Connection errors
- Invalid certificates
